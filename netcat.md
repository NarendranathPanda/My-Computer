-u: This shifts Netcat from TCP(default) to UDP mode
-p: For the listener, this is the listened port. For the client, this is source port.
-e: This is a very useful option. This tells what operation to perform after a successful connection.
-L: This makes a persistent listener. Work for Windows only
-wN: This option defines the timeout value. For example, w indicates to wait for 5 seconds before timeout.
